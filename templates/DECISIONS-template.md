# Architectural Decision Log

This log tracks all significant architectural decisions made during the development of this project. Decisions are numbered sequentially and follow a standard format for consistency and future reference.

## Decision #1 - {YYYY-MM-DD} - Initial Technology Stack Selection

**Context**: Starting a new project and need to choose the foundational technology stack including language, runtime, and core dependencies.

**Decision**: Selected TypeScript with Node.js runtime and [specific frameworks/libraries]

**Rationale**: 
- TypeScript provides compile-time type safety and better tooling
- Node.js has excellent ecosystem and performance characteristics
- [Framework] offers [specific benefits relevant to project]
- Strong community support and long-term viability

**Alternatives**: 
- Python with FastAPI - Good for rapid development but weaker typing
- Go - Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem for [project domain]
- Java with Spring - Enterprise-grade but heavier than needed

**Impact**: 
- Sets foundation for all subsequent development decisions
- Determines available libraries and development patterns
- Influences team expertise requirements and onboarding

## Decision #2 - {YYYY-MM-DD} - Testing Strategy Framework

**Context**: Need to establish comprehensive testing approach to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

**Decision**: Implement three-tier testing strategy with Jest framework and custom test organization

**Rationale**:
- Unit tests catch logic errors early in development
- Integration tests verify component interactions
- End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows
- Jest provides excellent TypeScript support and developer experience

**Alternatives**:
- Mocha + Chai - More flexible but requires more setup
- Vitest - Faster but newer with smaller ecosystem
- Test-driven development only - Too rigid for exploratory development

**Impact**:
- Establishes testing patterns for entire project lifecycle
- Enables confident refactoring and feature additions
- Requires test maintenance overhead but improves code quality

---

## Decision #3 - {YYYY-MM-DD} - [Example Decision Title]

**Context**: [Describe the situation that required a decision]

**Decision**: [State clearly what was decided]

**Rationale**: [Explain why this decision was made]

**Alternatives**: [List other options that were considered]

**Impact**: [Describe expected consequences and implications]

## Decision Categories

Common types of decisions that should be logged:

### Architecture & Design
- Component structure and responsibilities
- Data flow and processing patterns
- Interface design and API contracts
- System boundaries and integration points

### Technology Choices
- Library and framework selections
- Database and storage decisions
- Build tools and development workflow
- Deployment and infrastructure choices

### Quality & Process
- Testing strategies and coverage requirements
- Code quality standards and linting rules
- Documentation approaches and maintenance
- Release and deployment processes

### Performance & Scalability
- Optimization strategies and trade-offs
- Caching approaches and data structures
- Resource allocation and limiting
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Decision Review Process

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly review of recent decisions and their outcomes
- Quarterly assessment of major architectural choices
- Annual review of technology stack and major dependencies

### Impact Assessment
- Monitor actual vs. expected impacts of decisions
- Update decision records when outcomes differ from predictions
- Use learnings to improve future decision-making process

### Decision Reversal
When reversing or modifying previous decisions:
1. Create new decision entry explaining the change
2. Reference the original decision number
3. Explain what changed and why reversal was necessary
4. Update affected documentation and code comments
