# Coding Standards

Personal coding standards and templates for consistent, regenerable projects — especially those created with the help of AI.

## Quick Start

Reference in AI prompts →

```markdown
Follow my coding standards from `github.com/lukehhollenback/coding-standards`.
```

## Core Principles

1. **Regenerable**: Complete CLAUDE.md specification, from which the entire solution could be recreated.
2. **Documented**: All architectural decisions logged, and CLAUDE.md and README.md kept up-to-date.
3. **Tested**: 90%+ coverage, TDD approach.
4. **Quality**: Strict syntax enforcement, error handling, performance verification.
